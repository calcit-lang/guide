# Introduction

Calcit scripting language.

> an interpreter for calcit snapshot, and hot code swapping friendly.

Calcit is an interpreter built with Rust, and also a JavaScript code emitter. It's inspired mostly by ClojureScript. Calcit-js emits JavaScript in ES Modules syntax.

You can [try Calcit WASM build online](http://repo.calcit-lang.org/calcit-wasm-play/) for simple snippets.
